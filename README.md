- In this exercise, I was tasked with solving a series of problems, using the [**multiple pointers**](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/using-the-multiple-pointers-strategy-to-solve-algorithms-b90a98f854db) and [**frequency counter**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solve-technical-interview-questions-using-frequency-counter/) patterns.

## Testing
